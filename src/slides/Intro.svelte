		<h1 class="bebrush">why <span class="orange">history?</span></h1>
		<aside class="notes">
				Studying history helps us understand how events in the past made things the way they are today. With lessons from the past, we not only learn about ourselves and how we came to be, but also develop the ability to avoid mistakes and create better paths for our societies.
				Before diving into the topic, I want to clarify certain things
				The numbers and the dates mentioned here may not be accurate
				My intention is not to provide an highly accurate estimation but instead a broad history of events and anecdotes
				The historian always oversimplifies and hastily selects a manageable minority of facts
				Because compressing 28 years of history in 30 minutes is impossible to accomplish

				So in this talk we are going to look at the evolution of CSS through the lens of problems and solutions
				In other words, we will be taking a brief look at various technologies surrounding CSS, the problems they are supposed to solve,
				the problems they are not supposed to create and how the subsequent tooling solved them and still evolving.
