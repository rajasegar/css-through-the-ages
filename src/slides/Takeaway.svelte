		<h3>Takeaway #1</h3>
		<h2 class="bebrush orange">Means and instrumentalities change <br>Ends and motives remain the same</h2>
		<aside class="notes">
				The tools and technologies we use to build and compile CSS keep on changing and evolving
				but remember all the browser can understand and appreciate is plain old CSS
				So the means doesn't matter much if the ends are not met

		<h3>Takeaway #2</h3>
		<h2 class="bebrush orange">Problems are inevitable</h2>
		<h2 class="bebrush orange">Problems are soluble</h2>

		<h3>Takeaway #3</h3>
		<h2 class="bebrush orange">No Universal prescription</h2>
		<p>Y.M.M.V</p>
		<aside class="notes">

				There is no universal way of doing things with CSS. No one tool will address all problems or cater
				to the need of different codebases. Use what works for you.

		<h1 class="bebrush">surprise?</h1>
		<aside class="notes">
				Before winding up, I have a little surprise for the audience.
				It is a customary thing to launch a new tool or showcase some new technology in conferences
				So for this Dev hours session I have something for you people.
				I had so much fun preparing for this talk, so while preparing and
				putting together the slides, I had an idea of creating a timeline of
				all the important things about CSS, about most of which you have listened to in this presentation.
				So here it is? Let's launch and tweet about it.
